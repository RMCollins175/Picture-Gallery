This is a small pet project of mine. I wanted to practice react, react routing and implement bootstrap with react. 

### `Purpose`

To practice React concepts. Specifically:

- state

### `Next Steps`

- testing
- fetching from StumbleUpon API and using axios
- using functional components
- using local storage to store likes/reset likes
- authentication / being able to sign in, view, add likes, download content
- different font and more interesting styling 


### `npm start`

Clone first
npm start runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
